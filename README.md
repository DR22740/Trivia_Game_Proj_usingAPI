# Trivia_Game_Proj_usingAPI
This project is me working with an API and creating a simple trivia game. Final version should have a choice of difficulty, topic of questions, "you win page" and overall other cool gameplay mechanics like score health etc. This project uses API to get the questions with their difficulty and theme.
